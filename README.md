# Binary Trees
### Here I delve into the binary tree data structure:
- Difference between binary trees and binary search tree. In this project, I didn't work with BST's

- Depth, size, and height of binary trees

- Traversal methods of binary trees (Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder).

- Difference between Complete, full, perfect, and balanced tree
